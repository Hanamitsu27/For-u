        <p> For the most precious person in my life.<br>
		I am greatful to live with the same life<br>
		time with you. Meeting you was a nice <br>
		incident.Maybe somewhere in the universe
		you'll confuse why i created this.
		Actually i am going to encode all my 
		thoughts in my notebook here because 
		i dont think we can be able to meet,
		i mean its been a long time since we
		last saw each other and my notebook is 
		nearly fulled also i dont know when we
		will meet again.
		<br>
		<br>
		But first of all, ill know you'll hate this so
		please bare with me. I apologize to the way i
		acted lately. In fact,since i lost my phone i 
		see thing i never see before.Although i can 
		deny that it changed me in everyway.
		To be honest while im doing this i dont
		know my mindbecame blank. My thoughts 
		earlier dissapear.But here the things i 
		realize and discovered about myself:
			<li> Im attention seeker </li>
			<li> I invalidate you</li>
			<li> I take your freedom</li>
			<li> Impatience</li>
			<li> Lack of understanding</li>
			<li> Jealous</li>
			<li> Overthinker</li>
			<li> Nakakasakal</li>
			<li>Have low self-steem</li>
			<li> Nag-uumpisa ng mga dapat hindi umpisahin</li>
		I know this is long enough to read and 
		cassandra told me rin na wag ko to gawin.
		I mean this long chat liked were not even in a<br>
		relationship why i am being like this.
		After this realization i am became more
		confuse on everything.I tried to away
		myself to the things im lacking.
		I tried to change in every possible way.
		But i think thats not enough. 
		Naging manhid lang ako. 
		Naging heartless. Im trying my hardest 
		to not act how i feel but im sorry. 
		Ikaw lang kasi meron ako eh. 
		Ikaw lang nakikinig sakin. Wag ka
		ho mag-alala. Hindi nako magchachat
		ng ganto kahaba dahil ayaw ko rin 
		maging burden sayo.Weirdo ko noh HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.
		Ang hirap ba ihandle ni izra. 
		Di na me magtataka bat most people
		na nage-enter sa life ko nagsasawa in
		the end because of this mentality of mine.
		<br>
		<br>
		Tbh, i miss us. Those calls, updates, hugs,
		kisses, kurot, palo, tadyak, dates, random
		imissyou text, chika, asaran, and our first 
		dance nung bday mo.Kahit gustohin
		ko man sabihin sayo na balik na tayo sa
		dati to make it right, i cant afford to 
		see na mapilitan ka.Kaya here i am 
		patiently waiting and trying to 
		endure this pain of mine.
		Pain of my thoughs. I always say
		in my mind na if someday mamiss mo man ako,
		tayo at kung kailangan mo pa ko. 
		At kung marealize mo na gusto mo pa pala
		ako. Dont hesitate to comeback dahil you 
		know you have special spot in my heart.
		But turns out im delusional. Assuming. 
		Who am i to say that. Kaya lately 
		parang ganon ako makipaginteract
		dahil i respectingyour time. Your energy. 
		I mean you deserve to live a happylife and 
		<br>if ako lang din pala ang sumisira non i
		should be a understanding friend. I stop assume. 
		I stop to expect something from myself.
		I stop and tried not to feel anything. Thats
		 why naging manhid ako. So heres my
		 thoughts pala sa notebook. Just click this
		 Google Docs link nalang so di masyadong
		mahaba toh i know its irritating 
		and nakakatamad basahin.

		I dont know if nagbago ba yung sinabe
		mo sakin non na "gusto mo ulitin ang lahat" maybe that phrase of yours stock on my mind kaya nagkakaroon ako ng thoughts like this.
		But i thank God for giving me a chance to hold you once. How i wish i could still say that you mine just like before. Maybe ill just reminiscing our old times than to assume something
		that is impossible. From the bottom of my heart i thankyou for the sincire love and care you give me before. I really appreciate your patience for me. I wish we could have more time.
		Ik we have now difference paths. And i now see its been hard for you sa pagbabago ko. Im sorry you have to feel like that. Ik its late but i want to take this chance para makipagayos
		sayo fully despite sa status natin. I want us to fix. If i may ask lets have a communication and talk it all and resolve it. I humbly ask you formally how can i make things up to you?
		ik sinabe mo na wait ko yung notebook na ibibigay mo kaya sorry if para akong nagmamadali. Tho im tired and confused. And avoid the things i need to avoid. I am not letting 
		you na ipilit sarili mo to become open me.
		<br>
		<br>
		If youre having a hard time. Cheer up! malalagpasan mo rin lahat ng hirap. Ik its been hard na pasan mo lahat but take it easy. Dont push yourself from the expectaion of others. 
		Ik surviving each day is tough and feels heavy but be gentle with yourself. Dont pressure and stress yourself that much. Your doing great even tho ik your tired and drained. Always know that
		i am proud of how doing your best everyday. I will always proud of your accomplishment as your friend whether small or big. You deserve nothing but success and happiness. I will Always
		be your number one fan,cheering you silently. No words can express how much i prayed for you. Take care of yourself.
		<br>
		<br>
		Despite of this challenges. Despite na naging manhid ako. Despite i changed. Despite knowing na wala kanang nararamdaman sakin. Despite i stop assuming something. Despite
		i stop ask for bare minimum. I always care for you. This feelings of mine that i try to avoid to show lies in my own nalang. I dunno if it will fade but all i want to say
		is even in the things i dont understand us. I cared for you and only you. Even tho im fighting the urge to stop myself for being makulit and stay from being manhid youll still 
		the one i will called home. Im here even i dont know if you need me. I may not be the most important person in your life rn but i hope youre okay. Maybe were friend or had some 
		romantic connection before, i will always here if you need me nor you dont need me. I wish for whats best for you. I hope you stand strong even at your weakest point. I hope 
		maachieve mo ung mga bagay na gusto mo maachieve. Nandito lang ako, clapping proudly for you from afar. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Hey? Dont worry a single thing about us. I mean yeah im just a friend of yours and a nobody. Even i dont have the rights to say this. If you ever worried about losing me always know
		na im always here naman. Alam mo naman san ako hahanapin at pano ako hahanapin. I am definitely yours. You know naman when ill stop eh. You know me very well naman din. Id rather
		choose you in a hundred lifetime. Ikaw parin naman eh walang bago. Pinipigilan ko lang sarili ko sa mga bagay na maaaaring makasira sa kung ano meron tayo ngayon kahit magkaibigan lang.
		If love find me again. I wish it was you.<br>
		Sorry i make things hard for you i dont have anything to offer but my sincirity and this flower i made. Click the button to see.
